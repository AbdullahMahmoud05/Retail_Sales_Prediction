## Project Overview

This project predicts the **Total Spent** in a retail transaction using customer, product, and transaction-related features.

The model was trained using **Linear Regression** from Scikit-learn and deployed through **Streamlit** to provide real-time sales predictions through an interactive web interface.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains retail transaction records including:

* Product information
* Pricing information
* Purchase quantity
* Discount information
* Payment methods
* Store locations
* Transaction dates

### Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

* Handling missing values
* Data cleaning
* Feature selection
* Date feature extraction
* Model-ready dataset preparation

---

## Features Used

### Input Features

* Category
* Price Per Unit
* Quantity
* Payment Method
* Location
* Discount Applied
* Year
* Month
* Day
* Weekday

### Target Variable

* Total Spent

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Joblib
* Streamlit

---

## Machine Learning Model

### Linear Regression

The final model was trained using Scikit-learn's Linear Regression algorithm.

Several regression approaches were explored and compared before selecting the final model.

### Evaluation Metrics

* R² Score
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
